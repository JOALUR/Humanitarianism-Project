# Humanitarianism-Project
Pluto Hacks Hackathon 2022 
-- project I worked on with 3 other people
-- Won best first hackathon
-- Wasn't really finished but had an idea about making a chatbot and memory board for elderly suffering with dementia
-- This was to give them someone to talk to, get reminders, and even engage in learning activities
